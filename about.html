		<p>Just like the Oppo A5, the Oppo A5s is reported to have a 6.2-inch HD+ (720x1520 pixels) resolution display, although there's no mention if it will come with any sort of scratch protection such as Gorilla Glass. Around the back, the Oppo A5s appears to have a two-camera setup — one 13-megapixel primary sensor with an f/2.2 aperture and a 2-megapixel depth sensor with an f/2.4 aperture. It has an 8-megapixel front camera with a f/2.0 aperture. The phone is backed by a 4,230mAh battery. According to the leak, the phone will unfortunately not run ColorOS 6.0 out-of-the-box. Instead, it will have ColorOS 5.2 which is based on Android 8.2 Oreo.</p>
